This repository provides code for the Molecular Weight V4.1 Excel add-in. After installing, users can get the molecular weight of a string by calling the new Excel function mw(chemicalName), e.g. typing in a cell =mw("H2O") would yield 18.01528. This add-in can handle isotopes, charges, and complex formulas. This add-in also allows users to specify custom names for both chemicals (e.g. "water" for H2O) and specific functional groups (e.g. "Me" for CH3).

The codes were originally created at http://www.sciencechatforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=17657, but the site is now inaccessible.
